In this study, **Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy** and **Datetime** libraries were used and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed on earthquake data.

Some of the questions I aim to answer for earthquakes that have occurred in 30 days:
- What was the magnitude range in which earthquakes occurred?
- What was the number of countries with seismic events worldwide?
- Where did earthquakes occur most frequently?
- Where was the locations where the earthquake magnitude is 6 or higher?
- Where were the earthquake points concentrated?
- What was the relationship between the depth and magnitude of earthqakes?
- What was the magnitute distribution of the earthquakes?
- What was the distribution of seismic event types?
- What was the mean magnitude of seismic activities?
- What was the Rate of Human-Reviewed Earthquakes?
